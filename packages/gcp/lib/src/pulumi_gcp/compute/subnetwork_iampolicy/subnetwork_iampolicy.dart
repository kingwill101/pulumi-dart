/// Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Compute Engine Subnetwork. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
///
/// * `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the subnetwork and replaces any existing policy already attached.
/// * `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the subnetwork are preserved.
/// * `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the subnetwork are preserved.
///
/// A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
///
/// * `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the subnetwork
///
/// > **Note:** `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMBinding` and `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
///
/// > **Note:** `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
///
/// > **Note:**  This resource supports IAM Conditions but they have some known limitations which can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview#limitations). Please review this article if you are having issues with IAM Conditions.

/// ## Import
///
/// For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:
///
/// * projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/subnetworks/{{name}}
///
/// * {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
///
/// * {{region}}/{{name}}
///
/// * {{name}}
///
/// Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.
///
/// Compute Engine subnetwork IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
///
/// IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/subnetworkIAMPolicy:SubnetworkIAMPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/subnetworks/{{subnetwork}} roles/compute.networkUser user:jane@example.com"
/// ```
///
/// IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/subnetworkIAMPolicy:SubnetworkIAMPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/subnetworks/{{subnetwork}} roles/compute.networkUser"
/// ```
///
/// IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/subnetworkIAMPolicy:SubnetworkIAMPolicy editor projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/subnetworks/{{subnetwork}}
/// ```
///
/// -> **Custom Roles** If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
///
/// full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
