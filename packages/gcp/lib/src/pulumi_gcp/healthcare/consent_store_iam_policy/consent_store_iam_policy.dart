///
/// * `gcp.healthcare.ConsentStoreIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the consentstore and replaces any existing policy already attached.
/// * `gcp.healthcare.ConsentStoreIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the consentstore are preserved.
/// * `gcp.healthcare.ConsentStoreIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the consentstore are preserved.

///
/// For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:

/// * {{dataset}}/consentStores/{{name}}

/// * {{name}}
///
/// Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.

/// Cloud Healthcare consentstore IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
///
/// IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:healthcare/consentStoreIamPolicy:ConsentStoreIamPolicy editor "{{dataset}}/consentStores/{{consent_store}} roles/viewer user:jane@example.com"
/// ```
///
/// IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:healthcare/consentStoreIamPolicy:ConsentStoreIamPolicy editor "{{dataset}}/consentStores/{{consent_store}} roles/viewer"
/// ```
///
/// IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:healthcare/consentStoreIamPolicy:ConsentStoreIamPolicy editor {{dataset}}/consentStores/{{consent_store}}
/// ```

/// -> **Custom Roles** If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
