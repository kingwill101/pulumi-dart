/// Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Cloud AI Notebooks Instance. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
///
/// * `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the instance and replaces any existing policy already attached.
/// * `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the instance are preserved.
/// * `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the instance are preserved.
///
/// A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
///
/// * `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the instance
///
/// > **Note:** `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamBinding` and `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.

///
/// For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:
///
/// * projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_name}}
///
/// * {{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_name}}
///
/// * {{location}}/{{instance_name}}
///
/// * {{instance_name}}
///
/// Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.
///
/// Cloud AI Notebooks instance IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
///
/// IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:notebooks/instanceIamPolicy:InstanceIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_name}} roles/viewer user:jane@example.com"
/// ```
///
/// IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:notebooks/instanceIamPolicy:InstanceIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_name}} roles/viewer"
/// ```
///
/// IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:notebooks/instanceIamPolicy:InstanceIamPolicy editor projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_name}}
/// ```
///
/// -> **Custom Roles** If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
///
/// full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
