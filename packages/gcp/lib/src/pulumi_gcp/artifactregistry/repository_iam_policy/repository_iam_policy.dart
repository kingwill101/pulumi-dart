/// * `gcp.artifactregistry.RepositoryIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the repository and replaces any existing policy already attached.
/// * `gcp.artifactregistry.RepositoryIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the repository are preserved.
/// * `gcp.artifactregistry.RepositoryIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the repository are preserved.

///
/// For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:
///
/// * projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/repositories/{{repository}}
///
/// * {{project}}/{{location}}/{{repository}}
///
/// * {{location}}/{{repository}}
///
/// * {{repository}}
///
/// Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.
///
/// Artifact Registry repository IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
///
/// IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:artifactregistry/repositoryIamPolicy:RepositoryIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/repositories/{{repository}} roles/artifactregistry.reader user:jane@example.com"
/// ```
///
/// IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:artifactregistry/repositoryIamPolicy:RepositoryIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/repositories/{{repository}} roles/artifactregistry.reader"
/// ```
///
/// IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:artifactregistry/repositoryIamPolicy:RepositoryIamPolicy editor projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/repositories/{{repository}}
/// ```
///
/// -> **Custom Roles** If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
///
/// full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
