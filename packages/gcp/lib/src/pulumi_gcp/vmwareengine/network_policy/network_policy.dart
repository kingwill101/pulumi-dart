/// Represents a network policy resource. Network policies are regional resources.
///
///
/// To get more information about NetworkPolicy, see:
///
/// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.networkPolicies)
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ### Vmware Engine Network Policy Basic
///
///
///
/// ### Vmware Engine Network Policy Full
///
///
///
///
/// ## Import
///
/// NetworkPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
///
/// * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/networkPolicies/{{name}}`
///
/// * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
///
/// * `{{location}}/{{name}}`
///
/// When using the `pulumi import` command, NetworkPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:vmwareengine/networkPolicy:NetworkPolicy default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/networkPolicies/{{name}}
/// ```
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:vmwareengine/networkPolicy:NetworkPolicy default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
/// ```
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:vmwareengine/networkPolicy:NetworkPolicy default {{location}}/{{name}}
/// ```
