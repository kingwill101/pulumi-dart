  /// [ttl] Input only. The TTL (time to live) of the product. Note that this is only applicable to Type.PRIMARY and Type.COLLECTION, and ignored for Type.VARIANT. In general, we suggest the users to delete the stale products explicitly, instead of using this field to determine staleness. If it is set, it must be a non-negative value, and expire_time is set as current timestamp plus ttl. The derived expire_time is returned in the output and ttl is left blank when retrieving the Product. If it is set, the product is not available for SearchService.Search after current timestamp plus ttl. However, the product can still be retrieved by ProductService.GetProduct and ProductService.ListProducts.
  /// [type] Immutable. The type of the product. Default to Catalog.product_level_config.ingestion_product_type if unset.
  /// [uri] Canonical URL directly linking to the product detail page. It is strongly recommended to provide a valid uri for the product, otherwise the service performance could be significantly degraded. This field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
