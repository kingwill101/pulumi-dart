For example, connection timeouts. - retriable-4xx: a retry is attempted if the instance or endpoint responds with a 4xx response code. The only error that you can retry is error code 409. - refused-stream: a retry is attempted if the instance or endpoint resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM error code.
