You cannot reference environment variables set in the Docker image. In order for environment variables to be expanded, reference them by using the following syntax: $(VARIABLE_NAME) Note that this differs from Bash variable expansion, which does not use parentheses. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string is used unchanged. To avoid variable expansion, you can escape this syntax with `$$`; for example: $$(VARIABLE_NAME)
