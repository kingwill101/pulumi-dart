/// App Engine Routing. Defines routing characteristics specific to App Engine - service, version, and instance. For more information about services, versions, and instances see [An Overview of App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine), [Microservices Architecture on Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/microservices-on-app-engine), [App Engine Standard request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed), and [App Engine Flex request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-requests-are-routed). Using AppEngineRouting requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`
